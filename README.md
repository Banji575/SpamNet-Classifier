# SpamNet-Classifier

SpamNet-Classifier is a sophisticated machine learning project aimed at identifying and classifying spam messages using deep learning techniques. This model is particularly useful in filtering spam from legitimate messages in various applications such as email clients and messaging platforms.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow & Keras**: For building and training the deep learning model.
- **Gensim**: To access pre-trained word embeddings like GloVe.
- **NumPy**: For numerical and array operations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For metrics computation such as accuracy score and confusion matrix.
- **Python**: The primary programming language for the project.
